This second-semester project is developed using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The Assignment Management System (AMS) helps students and instructors manage assignments efficiently while applying key OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… Add, update, and delete assignments
âœ… Track deadlines and submission status
âœ… Organized data management for efficiency
âœ… User-friendly interface (if applicable)

This project enhances my Java development skills by solving real-world academic management challenges. It demonstrates how OOP principles can be applied to create structured, efficient, and scalable systems.
